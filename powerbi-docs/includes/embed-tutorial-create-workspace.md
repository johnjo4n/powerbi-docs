Microsoft Fabric keeps your reports, dashboards, and tiles in a workspace. To embed these items, you need to create them and upload them into a workspace.

>[!TIP]
>If you already have a workspace, you can skip this step.

To create a workspace, do the following:

1. Sign in to Fabric.

2. Select **Workspaces**.

3. Select **+ New workspace**.

4. Name your workspace and select **Save**.
